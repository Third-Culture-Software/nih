        <h2>Request for Proposal (RFP) No. NIH-OBSSR-2024-05</h2>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong> Quantifying the Cuteness Epidemic: Documentation of Cat Populations in New Orleans Parish and its Impact on Public Health Graduate Students</p>
        <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> May 1, 2024<br>
           <strong>Proposal Due Date:</strong> May 31, 2024<br>
           <strong>Award Amount:</strong> $300
        </p>

        <h2>Program Description</h2>
        <p>The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is soliciting proposals for an innovative study to document and analyze the cat populations in New Orleans Parish with a focus on the "cuteness epidemic" and its psychological and behavioral impacts on public health graduate students. This project aims to explore the influence of exposure to cute animals, particularly cats, on the academic persistence and lifestyle choices of this demographic.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Emerging research indicates that exposure to "cute" animals can significantly affect human behavior and decision-making processes. The phenomenon, often referred to as the "cuteness epidemic," poses potential health risks, such as increased distraction, reduced productivity, and a higher propensity for adopting pets, which may affect academic and professional commitments. This is particularly relevant for graduate students in public health, who are at risk of lower graduation rates and altered career trajectories due to these distractions. Preliminary studies suggest the need for a deeper understanding of this phenomenon to develop effective interventions (Smith & Jones, 2023).</p>

        <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct a comprehensive survey of both domestic and feral cat populations in New Orleans Parish, with an emphasis on documenting instances of high cuteness.</li>
            <li>Assess the impact of exposure to these cats on public health graduate students in terms of academic engagement, dropout rates, and pet adoption behaviors.</li>
            <li>Develop strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of the cuteness epidemic on this vulnerable population.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Funding Information</h2>
        <p>An award of $300 will be granted to support the initial phase of this project, which includes the development of project methodology, preliminary data collection, and initial analysis. Further funding will be pursued based on the results of this phase.</p>

        <h2>Eligibility Information</h2>
        <p>Applicants should possess expertise in behavioral sciences, psychology, veterinary studies, or public health, and have a demonstrated ability to manage large-scale surveys and data analysis.</p>

        <h2>Application and Submission Information</h2>
        <p>Applications must include a detailed project description that outlines the approach for data collection, particularly how cuteness will be quantified and its effects measured. A budget outline that justifies the initial expenses. CVs of all project personnel, with emphasis on relevant experience and skills.</p>
        <p>Please submit proposals electronically via the NIH proposal submission portal by the due date mentioned above.</p>

        <h2>Review and Selection Process</h2>
        <p>Proposals will be evaluated by a panel comprising experts in psychology, behavioral sciences, and public health. The selection criteria will include the scientific and innovative merit of the proposed study, the feasibility of the methodology, and the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the cuteness epidemic.</p>

        <h2>Award Administration Information</h2>
        <p>The award will be administered according to NIH guidelines, ensuring adherence to fiscal responsibility and scientific integrity.</p>
